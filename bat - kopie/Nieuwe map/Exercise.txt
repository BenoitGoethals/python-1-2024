Exercise
The following questions give you a chance to practice writing arithmetic expressions.

How many seconds are there in 42 minutes 42 seconds?

How many miles are there in 10 kilometers? Hint: there are 1.61 kilometers in a mile.

If you run a 10 kilometer race in 42 minutes 42 seconds, what is your average pace in seconds per mile?

What is your average pace in minutes and seconds per mile?

What is your average speed in miles per hour?

If you already know about variables, you can use them for this exercise. If you don't, you can do the exercise without them -- and then we'll see them in the next chapter.
